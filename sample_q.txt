 Case Study
The Perfect Story
<company logo>

1.	About a client 
Generic overview
Client: Fictional global retailer “ApexWear Group” (multi brand, omnichannel).
Context: Rapid growth created fragmented data estates across regions and brands. The client engaged Capgemini to deliver a zero disruption migration to a governed, analytics ready cloud platform supporting finance, supply chain, and digital commerce.


2.	Business & Technical Context
Business Challenges
○	That were presented to us
■	Market expansion
■	Conquering a new market
■	Unable to scale
■	Business optimization
■	Etc.

Presented to us: The client sought to: expand into new markets without risking reporting outages; scale analytics to support seasonal spikes; optimize operational costs; and standardize compliance controls across regions.


○	That we discovered along the way
■	Stakeholders are not aligned
■	Hit technology limitations
■	Etc.

Discovered along the way: Stakeholder priorities were not fully aligned; legacy platforms hit scale limits; lineage gaps complicated audits; and data ownership models varied by business unit.
Business Goals
○	That were presented to us
■	TBD
■	Etc.
Presented to us: Ensure uninterrupted operations during migration; centralize trusted data for faster decisions; reduce run rate costs; and enforce consistent governance and PII policies across brands.
TBD (to confirm with client): Target KPIs for time to insight, cost savings, and compliance SLAs.

Technical Limitations & Challenges
○	That were presented to us
Presented to us: Mixed legacy RDBMS and file shares; inconsistent schemas; limited automation; ad hoc data quality checks.

○	That we discovered along the way
Discovered along the way: Hidden downstream dependencies; non standard ETL jobs; limited non prod environments for safe cutover rehearsals.

○	Existing tech stack
Existing tech stack: On prem RDBMS (SQL Server/Oracle), legacy ETL (cron + scripts), Excel driven reporting. (Illustrative; finalize in discovery)

○	Existing architecture
Existing architecture: Siloed per region; point to point feeds; minimal cataloging/lineage.

○	Existing development, release and deployment processes or practices
Existing dev/release/deploy: Manual scripts; no unified CI/CD; environment drift.

○	Accumulated technical debt
Accumulated tech debt: Duplicated transforms; hard coded credentials; missing tests.

○	Limitations of technology/platform/cloud/etc. selection
Platform limitations: Scale, observability, and governance gaps.

○	TBD: List of stakeholders
Stakeholders (TBD): CIO, Data Platform Owner, Business Unit Data Leads, Security & Compliance

○	Etc.





3.	Solution
Step-by-step story
Designed the target cloud architecture and provisioned landing zones as code to ensure scalable, policy driven foundations. 
Ingested and centralized data from legacy sources into a unified data lake, establishing standardized layers for reliable access. 
Standardized business models with modular transformations to serve finance, supply chain, and e commerce domains. 
Enforced data quality and governance with automated tests, cataloging, lineage, and PII controls. 
Automated CI/CD to consistently ship infrastructure, pipelines, and data models across environments. 
Validated integrity through reconciliation and functional test suites prior to each staged cutover. 
Strengthened security and observability with centralized logging, monitoring, secrets management, and role based access. 
Enabled consumption by publishing curated, governed datasets for self service analytics and executive dashboards.

What was proposed by a client vs. proposed by our side
Client proposal: “Lift and shift” ETL jobs to the cloud with minimal change; manual verification post cutover. 
Our proposal: Target state architecture with standardized lakehouse layers, automated testing/governance, and CI/CD to reduce risk and total cost while accelerating analytics.
